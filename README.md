## 💡 Problem Statement & Solution

### Problem Statement
With increasing concerns over climate change and rising carbon emissions, there's an urgent need for innovative solutions that promote sustainable transportation and community awareness. Most existing systems lack real-time, user-friendly features that help individuals calculate, compare, and reduce their carbon footprint effectively.

### Solution
Ride2Green is a smart web application designed to promote eco-friendly commuting. By integrating a carbon footprint calculator, real-time community interaction, and a carpooling solution, the platform encourages sustainable practices while fostering a green-minded community.
Users can calculate their transportation emissions, share eco-friendly lifestyle tips, and coordinate carpools efficiently. Ride2Green simplifies green commuting while building a connected, environmentally conscious user base.
